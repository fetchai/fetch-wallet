## **[Chat]{.underline}**

The chat section of fetch wallet is the most advanced and useful
feature. Chat distinguishes itself from other wallets because only a few
wallets have this feature, which allows you to communicate with other
people via a wallet.

In the bottom menu, you can see the chat icon. To utilize this
functionality, you must have FET balance. You will now see the welcome
screen if you are connected to the Fetch hub network and click on it.
You can select how you want to utilize the messaging feature from this
point on. You may either:

1.  Everybody: - Enable it for all users.

2.  Only contacts in address book: - Just for contacts in your address
    book, enable it.

3.  Nobody: - Completely disable it.

Your privacy is very important, and the design of this function reflects
that. This is subject to change at any time. By selecting continue, you
register to use the

chat feature, allowing others to find your address and message you in
accordance with the privacy options you have chosen.

1.  Depending on your privacy settings, you can search for addresses or
    contacts in the New Chat page with whom you want to chat. You can
    only search for addresses that are saved in your address book if
    your privacy settings are set to Contacts Only. You can look for any
    random address and contact them if your privacy settings are set to
    Everyone.

    yet registered, an inactive label will appear under the contact.
