## . FET Domain

The fetch wallet us new feature is the.FET domain, which allows you to
add a domain with the.FET. When a domain is purchased, it is
automatically registered on the blockchain. This process is known as
automatic mining. We\'ll generate a new wallet address for you when you
register an Unstoppable account, mint all domains directly to this
address, and allow you to move these out to a personal wallet whenever
you choose.

All domains will be minted at the time of purchase thanks to changes
we\'re making to the way we mint Web3 names.

Now, when you sign up for an Unstoppable account, we\'ll generate a new
wallet address for you, mint all of your domains directly to this
address, and allow you to move them out to a personal wallet whenever
you want.

After you have registered your domain, this information will transfer
permanently from our database to the blockchain and then to your
cryptocurrency wallet.

To register a. FET domain:

-   Search a. FET name in the search bar and then register it.

-   Select MINT and click on the continue button.

-   Approve the mint.

-   You can see this domain in your domain list and you can update it
    anytime.
