**[Proposals]{.underline}**

Proposal in the context of cryptocurrency typically refers to a
mechanism by which users of a decentralised platform or blockchain
network can suggest and vote on changes or decisions related to the
protocol. These proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including
protocol upgrades, changes to token omics, or adjustments to governance
parameters.

1.  Create a Proposal: There is usually an option to create a new
    proposal. Users may need to provide details about the proposed
    change, rationale behind it, and any other relevant information.
    This could involve submitting a smart contract or transaction with
    the proposed changes.

2.  Submit and Confirm: After filling out the necessary information,
    users typically need to confirm and submit the proposal. This might
    involve signing a transaction with their wallet.

3.  Voting: Once the proposal is submitted, other users can review it
    and cast their votes. The specific voting mechanism can vary---some
    platforms may use a simple majority, while others might use a more
    complex voting system based on the number of tokens held by each
    voter.

4.  Follow the steps to create and vote for the proposals- 

> 1\. Navigate to the \"More\" section.
>
> 2\. Choose the \"Proposals (View)\" option.
>
> 3\. Explore and evaluate active, voted, and closed proposals within
> this section.

**[Axelar Bridge]{.underline}**

Axelar is a decentralized interoperability network that aims to connect
various blockchain ecosystems. The project focuses on building a
universal interoperability platform, known as the Axelar Network, to
enable seamless communication and transfer of assets across different
blockchains.

The term \"Axelar bridge\" likely refers to the bridge technology or
protocols developed by Axelar to facilitate interoperability between
blockchains. Blockchain bridges are essentially systems that enable the
transfer of assets or data between different blockchain networks.

The Axelar Bridge facilitates the transfer of EVM Chains (ERC 20) tokens
to Cosmos Chain (FET) tokens and vice versa. It serves as a bridge,
enabling the seamless transfer of tokens between different platforms.

**Axelar aimed to offer several key features in its interoperability
solution:**

-   **Decentralized Interoperability:** Axelar focuses on creating a
    decentralized network that allows different blockchain ecosystems to
    communicate and transfer assets without relying on a central
    authority.

-   **Universal Bridging Protocol:** Axelar aims to establish a
    universal bridging protocol that can connect various blockchains.
    This protocol is designed to be adaptable and work with different
    blockchain networks.

-   **Cross-Chain Communication:** The Axelar Network is designed to
    enable cross-chain communication, allowing users and developers to
    interact with multiple blockchains seamlessly. This includes the
    ability to transfer assets between different chains.

-   **Security and Reliability:** Axelar likely emphasizes security and
    reliability in its bridge technology to ensure the safe transfer of
    assets between blockchains. This may involve the use of
    cryptographic techniques and other security measures.

-   **Scalability:** Scalability is a crucial factor in blockchain
    networks, especially those focused on interoperability. Axelar may
    incorporate features or mechanisms to ensure that the network can
    handle a growing number of transactions and users.

**How to perform Axelar bridge transactions:**

-   **Understand Supported Chains:** Ensure that the blockchain networks
    you want to interact with are supported by the Axelar bridge.
    Different bridges may support different blockchain ecosystems.

-   **Connect Wallets**

-   **Select Assets:** Choose the assets you want to transfer between
    blockchains. Ensure that these assets are supported on both the
    source and destination chains.

-   **Initiate Transfer:** Depending on the Axelar bridge\'s user
    interface, there may be an option to initiate the transfer. This
    could involve specifying the amount of the asset you want to
    transfer and confirming the transaction.

-   **Verify Transaction Details:** Carefully review the transaction
    details, including fees and destination addresses, before confirming
    the transfer. Confirm that the details are accurate to avoid any
    potential errors.

-   **Confirm Transaction:** Once you are satisfied with the transaction
    details, confirm the transaction. This may involve signing the
    transaction with your wallet\'s private key.

-   **Wait for Confirmation:** Blockchain transactions typically require
    confirmation by the network. You may need to wait for a certain
    number of confirmations before the transfer is considered complete.

-   **Check Status:** Monitor the status of your transaction.

-   **Receive Assets on Destination Chain:** Once the transaction is
    confirmed, you should receive the transferred assets on the
    destination blockchain.

              For this feature, follow these steps in wallet :

1.  Go to the \"More\" section.

2.  opt for \"Axelar Bridge (Transfer).\"

3.  Pick the network for the transaction.

4.  Enter the recipient\'s address.

5.  Choose the token to transfer from the dropdown list.

6.  Input the amount you want to transfer.

7.  Click \"Get Deposit Address\" to finish the transaction.
