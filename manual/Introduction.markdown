# Introduction

> The Fetch Wallet allows for simple communication with the Fetch
> blockchain while also supporting Osmosis and Juno Network, two other
> Cosmos-based networks. Tokens can be
>
> transferred to other accounts directly through the wallet or through
> the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol.
>
> The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is supported by the
> Fetch Wallet, which was originally formed from the Keplr wallet. It is
> a general wallet for interfacing with the Fetch blockchain network and
> other ledgers created using the Cosmos-SDK.

> Fetch.ai creates a decentralised, democratised economy where

# Features of the Fetch Wallet

-   Tokens sent and received

-   Use the IBC protocol to transfer tokens.

-   Staking on supported chains, such as the Fetch ledger (Add stake and
    claim your returns).

-   Support for additional cosmos-based ledgers, such as Osmosis, Juno,
    and the Fetch blockchain

-   Support for numerous accounts, including the ability to import or
    create new ones.

-   Address Book, which makes it simple to retrieve frequently used
    accounts

-   Connect your existing hardware wallet.

-   Private keys and mnemonics are saved locally on the device and
    encrypted.

-   The implication is that neither Fetch nor the websites visited have
    access to this private information.

-   Ledger hardware wallet support for increased security.

# FET Tokens

> Fetch.ai is a blockchain-based open-access decentralised machine
> learning network that was developed with the goal of enabling the
> expansion and evolution of the digital economy without the
> intervention of humans. The network permits the involvement of other
> agents, such as humans, while also connecting devices and
>
> services to the Internet of Things.
>
> Fetch.ai develops the tools and infrastructure necessary to facilitate
> the growth of a decentralised, AI-based digital economy. The network
> links people, things, and
>
> services, allowing for collaboration and data sharing. Suppliers and
> consumers make up the Fetch.ai economy, which is centered on a variety
> of agents and ecosystems
>
> with a range of functions and use cases.
>
> A Proof of Stake system using AI, DAG, and Cosmos\' Tender Mint
> consensus method is used to secure Fetch.ai. To further safeguard user
> privacy while maintaining the platform\'s decentralisation and
> openness, the network employs differential privacy.
>
> Cryptography and game theory are combined in the Fetch.ai network to
> create an uncensored consensus mechanism.
>
> The Fetch.ai coin\'s utility is as follows: -FET is an ERC-20 token
> that serves as the network\'s utility token and may be used for a
> variety of purposes, including: -

-   On the Fetch.ai network, all transaction costs are paid with FET.

-   Developers can design agents on Fetch.ai; however to integrate the
    software agent into the Fetch.ai ecosystem, a particular quantity of
    FET must be invested.

-   FET serves as the medium of exchange for all business dealings
    between agents on Fetch.ai

-   Through the network consensus process, Fetch.ai users can stake FET
    and act as validator nodes.

## Import existing account

> If you have an account on the Fetch network, for example having had
> one already on the Fetch wallet and want to access it again, have an
> account on another wallet and wish to bring it to the Fetch wallet,
> you can import it into the Fetch wallet:

1.  Select Import existing account.

2.  Choose 12 /24 worlds or a private key

3.  Enter your mnemonic seed or private key

4.  Set a password for your account and give it a name. The next time
    > you wish to use the wallet or make significant changes to your
    > account, this password will be required.
