**Security & Privacy**

At Fetch.ai, we take user privacy and security very seriously. There have been numerous internal talks over the optimal product choices for users' privacy and safety.

1. In friend mode: - you have the choice of who can message you. This feature is primarily meant to be utilized by users connected to the Fetch.ai network. The same goes for communications from other users of the system spamming users. By choosing the Contact's privacy options, you can enable the messaging feature in "Friend Mode," which limits contact to those in your

   address book.

1. Blocking: -We want to make sure you can block anyone you do not want to speak to if you are open to making new relationships. If you do not want to be disturbed by a sender, we give users the option to block their communications.

1. Disappearing Messages: -Messages automatically delete after 14 days for privacy reasons. In the upcoming editions of the wallet, users will be able to back up their messages if necessary.
