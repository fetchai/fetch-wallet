## Staking

> Staking is the process of locking up some of your tokens to take part
> in the functioning of a blockchain network, boost its security, and
> receive some passive dividends. Proof-of-stake (POS) is the consensus
> protocol used by the open, decentralized blockchain network Fetch. For
> the operators of POS-based networks, sometimes referred to as
> validators, to be eligible for rewards from their labor, they must
> lock up some tokens.
>
> A validator must fulfil number of requirements, such as staking a
> minimum number of tokens. Users with fewer tokens could still
> participate by allocating stake to a certain validator to obtain a
> portion of the profits.
>
> To stack or unstack, simply follow these steps-

1.  Make sure you are logged into your Fetch wallet before you stake.

2.  Select Stake from the dashboard of your wallet. You should be taken
    > to the ledger browser after that. A list of all current validators
    > with whom you can

> stake your FETs can be found here. Additionally, you can view the FET
> staked to each validator as well as their commission rates.

    > and then click Stake or Unstake.
